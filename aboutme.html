                <h3>About me</h3>

                <p>I've been a computer enthusiast (nerd) from a very early age. When I was a child I would eagerly await visits to my computer programmer 
                Grandad's house, on which I would dash to see what new software he'd installed on his state-of-the-art (relatively speaking) PC. Whether it was a 
                game, a digital drawing interface or some kind of file management utility, I'd click every button with manic glee in an attempt to discover how the 
                processes worked until that poor, over-worked tower crashed under the weight of it's own RAM.</p>
      
                <p>Now, after a lifetime of dabbling in coding, I feel I have reached the limits of what I can learn from scattered self-teaching and have signed
                up to a software engineering course. So far it has been a fascinating and eye-opening experience. Perhaps the first lesson I've learned is 
                that tasks that seem complicated to me can often be accomplished with a neat couple of lines of code, whereas 
                the tasks that I assume to be simple are often laborious and maddening (for example, it took me over two hours to get the below
                list all neat and centre-aligned).</p>
            
                <p>I live in Manchester, UK, and when I'm not sat at my laptop studying and brushing up on my coding skills, I'm most likely to be found:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sat at my laptop writing and producing music</li>
                    <li>Sat at my laptop editing videos</li>
                    <li>In my kitchen, making a sandwich and talking to my pets</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h3>Music and production</h3>

                <p>I began an electro-punk solo project, under the name of Geisterhaus, in the Autumn of 2018. My material is entirely self-produced and incorporates
                a mix of live vocals and guitars with programmed bass, synth and drum loops. I taught myself to produce and mix music mostly through trial
                and error. <br>
                The process is not unlike learning to code, in that there's lots of twiddling and head-scratching as well as gloriously satisfying "aha!" moments
                that they make it all worth while.</p>

                <p>I released my debut album, Bones on Record, in 2019. My music can be streamed on all of the major streaming platforms.</p>

                <h3>Video editing</h3>

                <p>Throughout the course of my musical career, I have produced and edited many music videos. In the early days I used Apple's iMovie application but
                FXhome's HitFilm Express has more recently become my editor of choice. The interface is a little less intuitive, but it provides a lot more freedom in 
                the creation of visual effects and makes the editing process a lot smoother. As with coding, I find making mistakes to be a vital part of the process. 
                Firstly because mistakes provide a deeper insight into the workings of different processes, and secondly because mistakes can lead to very 
                interesting, if unintended, results and effects (sometimes more appealing than the initial desired effect!)</p>

                <p>In 2019 I made a short comedy/horror film called "Chasm of Lies" alongside three friends. We wrote, produced and directed the project together but,
                naturally, I took on the responsibility of editing the film and providing the music. Compared to my previous music video projects, which typically have
                a running time of 2-4 minutes, the task of working on a half-hour film was gargantuan. However the process was rewarding and enriching, granting me the 
                opportunity to add a myriad of tricks and techniques to my repertoire.</p>

                <h3>Sandwiches/Pets</h3>

                <p>My favourite sandwich is vegan ham, vegan mayo, tomato and lettuce on seeded brown bread. If I'm feeling fancy I'll have
                    falafel with houmous, chilli sauce, spring onions and spinach (again, on seeded brown).</p> 
                    
                <p>My pets are as follows:</p>
