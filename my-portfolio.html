        Tom Hammersley, also known as Tom Hammersley, is better known by his stage name: Tom <em>Hammersley</em>.
        <hr>
        Born in Manchester in 1987 and raised by wolves, Tom spent the first 18 years of his life roaming Wythenshawe park on all fours and
        growling at dogs. A life long vegetarian, he lived on the salt, crumbs and E numbers inside discarded crisp packets.
        When he entered adulthood, Tom was encouraged by his family to join human society and he quickly learned that one needs only three skills to 
        survive in this cruel, unforgiving world: <br>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Operating a computer</li>
                <li>Not growling at dogs</li>
                <li>Making sandwiches</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        He's still working on the first two, but his Mum (a wolf) says his signature bread sandwiches are second to none.
        </p>
 
        <p>Tom has been making electro-punk music under the name of "Geisterhaus" since 2018. He makes and records his music at home using
            only his mind, a laptop and a guitar (and sometimes wine). He has released one 
        <a href="https://geisterhausss.bandcamp.com/album/bones-on-record-2" alt="link to album" target="_blank">album</a>, 
        one stand-alone <a href="https://geisterhausss.bandcamp.com/track/idle-hands" alt="link to single" target="_blank">single </a>
        and four <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Dx24kEzlKocoMjsplHRag" alt="link to videos" target="_blank">music videos.</a>
