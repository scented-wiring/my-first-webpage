    <article>

        <p>Hello, I'm Tom Hammersley. I live in Manchester, UK, and
        I've been a computer enthusiast (read: nerd) from a very early age. When I was a child I would eagerly await visits to my computer programmer 
        Grandad's house, on which I would dash to see what new software he'd installed on his state-of-the-art (relatively speaking) PC. Whether it was a 
        game, a digital drawing interface or some kind of file management utility, I'd click every button with manic glee in an attempt to discover how the 
        processes worked until that poor, over-worked tower crashed under the weight of it's own RAM.</p>
      
        <p>Now after a lifetime of experimenting, self-teaching and dabbling in HTML and CSS, I have signed up to a software engineering course to focus
        my knowledge. So far it has been a fascinating and eye-opening experience. Perhaps the first lesson I've learned is 
        that daunting and complicated-seeming tasks can often be accomplished with surprising ease and a couple of lines of code, whereas 
        the tasks that you assume to be simple can be laborious and maddening (for example, it took me over two hours to get the below
        list all neat and centre-aligned).</p>
            
        <p>When I'm not sat at my laptop studying and brushing up on my coding skills, I'm most likely to be found:
            <ul>
                <li>Sat at my laptop writing and producing music</li>
                <li>Sat at my laptop editing videos</li>
                <li>In the kitchen, making a sandwich and talking to my pets</li>
            </ul></p>

    <h2>Music and production</h2>

        <p>I began an electro-punk solo project, under the name of Geisterhaus, in the Autumn of 2018. My material is entirely self-produced and incorporates
        a mix of live vocals and guitars with programmed bass, synth and drum loops. I taught myself to produce and mix music mostly through trial
        and error. <br>
        The process is not unlike learning to code in that there's lots of twiddling and head-scratching as well as glorious "aha!" moments
        so satisfying that they make it all worth while. 

        <br>My music can be streamed on 
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/48ovvIwKm71Q3D7Jn39vMY?si=QsSFe2lCRbGTva6mAvNi_A" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and 
        all other major streaming platforms. Press the button below to be redirected to my Bandcamp page, where you can purchase my album Bones on Record.</p>

    <h2>Video editing</h2>

        <p>Throughout the course of my musical career, I have produced and edited many music videos. In the early days I used Apple's iMovie application but
        FXhome's HitFilm Express has more recently become my editor of choice. The interface is a little less intuitive, but it provides a lot more freedom in 
        the creation of visual effects and makes the editing process a lot smoother. As with coding, I find making mistakes to be a vital part of the process. 
        Firstly because mistakes provide a deeper insight into the workings of different processes, and secondly because mistakes can lead to very 
        interesting, if unintended, results and effects (sometimes more appealing than the initial desired effect!)</p>

        <p>In 2019 I made a short comedy/horror film called "Chasm of Lies" alongside three friends. We wrote, produced and directed the project together but,
        naturally, I took on the responsibility of editing the film and providing the music. Compared to my previous music video projects, which typically have
        a running time of 2-4 minutes, the task of working on a half-hour film was gargantuan. However the process was rewarding and enriching, granting me the 
        opportunity to add a myriad of tricks and techniques to my repertoire.</p>
