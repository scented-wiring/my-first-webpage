        <p>I, Tom Hammersley, have been a computer enthusiast (read: nerd) from a very early age. When I was a child back in the nineties
            I would eagerly await visits to my computer programmer Grandad's house, on which I would make a dash to see what new software 
            he'd installed on his state-of-the-art (relatively speaking) PC. Whether it was a game, a digital drawing interface
            or some kind of file management utility, I would gleefuly click every button in an attempt to discover how the processes worked
            until that poor, over-worked computer crashed under the weight of it's own RAM.</p>
      
         <p>Now, after a lifetime of experimenting and self-teaching, I have made a concerted effort to focus my knowledge by signing
            up to a Software Engineering course. When I'm not sat at my laptop studying, I'm most likely to be found:
            <ul>
                <li>Sat at my laptop writing and producing music</li>
                <li>Sat at my laptop editing videos</li>
                <li>Sat at my laptop watching videos on game logic and programming</li>
                <li>In the kitchen, making a sandwich and having a bit of a rest</li>
            </ul></p>
 
        <p>Tom has been making electro-punk music under the name of "Geisterhaus" since 2018. He makes and records his music at home using
            only his mind, a laptop and a guitar (and sometimes wine). He has released one 
        <a href="https://geisterhausss.bandcamp.com/album/bones-on-record-2" alt="link to album" target="_blank">album</a>, 
        one stand-alone <a href="https://geisterhausss.bandcamp.com/track/idle-hands" alt="link to single" target="_blank">single </a>
        and four <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Dx24kEzlKocoMjsplHRag" alt="link to videos" target="_blank">music videos.</a>
        If you wish to subject yourself to this music you can click the button below to purchase his album, Bones on Record:

        <p>He is also active on social media and regularly broadcasts his asinine thoughts to literally <strong>tens</strong> of people.
