        Tom Hammersley, also known as Tom Hammersley, is better known by his stage name: <i>Tom Hammersley</i>
        Born in Manchester in 1987 and raised by wolves, Tom quickly learned that one needs only three skills to 
        survive in this cruel, unforgiving world:
            <ul>
                <li>Playing guitar</li>
                <li>Operating a computer</li>
                <li>Making sandwiches</li>
            </ul>   
        He's still working on the first two, but his Mum (a wolf) says his signature butter sandwiches are second to none.
